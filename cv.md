## About Me 
My main advantage is independence. While classmates ask me how the problem is solved, I solve my problems myself. I'm 25 and I have a lot of experience in different specialties, but at some point I realized that my personality would be good for programming. Since I was educated in the field of design and worked with HTML, CSS and JavaScript at the university, my choice immediately fell on Frontend.

• Fast learner <br>
• Developed soft skills<br>
• Logical thinking<br>

## Code example:
Digits explosion KATA from CODEWARS: *Given a string made of digits [0-9], return a string where each digit is repeated a number of times equals to its value.*

 ```function explode(s) {
  let result = '';

  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; ++i) {
  if (+s[i] === 0){
   result = result + '';
  } else {
   result = result + s[i].repeat(+s[i]);
  }
