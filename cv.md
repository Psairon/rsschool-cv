## About Me 
My best feature is independence. While all my classmates ask me how to solve the problem, I already solve it by myself. I'm 25 and I have a lot of experience in different specialties. But at some point I realized that programming is my cup of tea. Because I was educated in design and at the university I worked with applications like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, my choice immediately fell to Frontend developer. 

#### My strengths:
* I'm a fast learner;  
* I have well-developed soft skills;  
* I can boast of logical thinking;  
* And last but not least: I'am a skilled Google user.  

## Skills:
* HTML5, CSS3;  
* JavaScript Basics;  
* Git, GitHub;  
* VS Code;  
* Adobe Photoshop.  

## Code example:
Digits explosion KATA from CODEWARS: *Given a string made of digits [0-9], return a string where each digit is repeated a number of times equals to its value.*
 ```
 function explode(s) {
  let result = '';

  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; ++i) {
  if (+s[i] === 0){
   result = result + '';
  } else {
   result = result + s[i].repeat(+s[i]);
  }
 }
  console.log(result)
  return result;
 }
```
